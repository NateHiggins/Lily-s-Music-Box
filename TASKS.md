# OPEN TASKS

The shared queue. Everyone working on Orison writes here.

*2026-08-10: the arcade/compiler session took over the Orison work as well.
Sections A, C, L, N, S, U and the compiler-side items are all held by one
session now; that is a fact about staffing, not a claim of ownership over the
queue. Anyone may still add.*

**This is a list of open work, not a log.** Delete a task when it is done; git
history is the record. If a task is wrong, say so on the line rather than
quietly removing it.

## How to use it

- **Add to the bottom of a section.** Ids are permanent — never renumber.
- **Claim by putting your name in the line.** No name means unclaimed.
- **Section prefixes exist so two agents adding at once do not collide.**
  `D` decisions · `A` arcade · `S` studio · `M` materials · `H` housekeeping.
- One line each. If it needs a paragraph it needs a brief in `design/`.

---

## D — Needs a decision from the owner

Nothing below is blocked on effort; it is blocked on someone choosing.

- **D1** Studio: does the desk power up? A room the player can use is a system;
  a room they can only look into is a landmark. The layout supports either.
  *Blocks S1.*
- **D2** Studio: do the storage cages stay? Argued for in the brief, but it
  costs floor area.
- **D3** Studio: is the echo chamber's extra tail ever *heard*, or only measured
  on the reel?
- **D4** Studio: which resident is found down there, if any, and at what hour.
- **D5** Coarse-luminance threshold is **absolute** luma (0.02) — that is 2.6%
  relative on plaster at mean 0.70 and 13% on a dark floor. Perceptually
  backwards. Absolute or relative? Shared definition, so it binds both
  pipelines.
- **D6** Does **VIII.5.g retire "minigames"** as a frame? The ruling says there
  is no video game industry in this world, but the pool table, the darts, the
  can-stacking and "one minigame per landmark" are all still described as games.
  Pool and darts are 1927 pub games and survive untouched; the question is only
  whether anything *screen-shaped* may be a game, or whether every screen must
  be a received broadcast. Answer binds the bodega machine and everything after.

## A — Arcade / the signal parlour

Ruled in `ORISON_BIBLE.md` VIII.5.g. Docs: `game/docs/arcade_cabinets.md`.

- **A1** `.swcpkg` files almost certainly do **not** ship in an exported build.
  `export_presets.cfg` has `export_filter="all_resources"` with an empty
  `include_filter`, and `.swcpkg` has no Godot importer. Expected fix is
  `include_filter="*.swcpkg"` — **untested**. Export, install, confirm a cabinet
  still boots. Failure mode is a machine playing in graybox with no error.
- **A2** Nobody has played one. `arcade_panel.gd` is unproven in the hand: mouse
  capture and restore, ESC, `E`, and whether a 480×360 feed at 2× is aimable.
  Expect tuning, not repair.
- **A3** Machines never free their world. `set_live(false)` stops the board
  rendering but the built world stays in memory. Needs an unload policy on the
  same distance gate that governs `set_live`.
- **A4** Twelve live machines have never been profiled — twelve 3D worlds plus
  twelve phosphor viewports, gated at 9 m. Measure before adding more.
- **A5** Audio is undifferentiated: attract mode is silent and every machine
  shares one weapon report. The World Bible already carries a `sound_palette`
  per world and nothing consumes it. Probably the highest-value polish left.
- **A6** The held object is procedural GDScript built from `held_object`, not a
  compiled mesh shipped in the package like every other visual.
- **A7** `arcade_panel.gd` reads raw keys, bypassing Orison's input map — on
  purpose, so a cabinet cannot inherit the outer player's bindings, but it means
  no rebinding, no gamepad, no touch.
- **A8** Port drift: `game/scripts/arcade/swc_*.gd` is a deliberate *copy* of the
  compiler repo's runtime. Nothing checks the two have not diverged.
- **A9** Screen legibility at distance in the dark bar. Brightness floor on the
  feed, or accept it as atmosphere? Worth deciding rather than defaulting.
- **A10** Every spawned enemy is named `Enemy`, so Godot's rename-on-collision
  makes their degrade thresholds differ slightly. Cosmetic.

## S — Basement studio

Proposed in `design/ORISON_STUDIO_BRIEF.md`. Not canon until the owner rules.

- **S1** Author the studio and echo chamber in `gen_layout.py`. Studio in
  `B1_STORAGE_CAGES`, chamber in `B1_UTILITY`, clear height 2.62 m. Never
  hand-edit `building_layout.json`. *Blocked by D1.*
- **S2** Six new Blender assemblies: `mixing_desk`, `monitor_pair`, `patch_bay`,
  `control_glass`, `acoustic_drape`, `chamber_fitting`. Reuse the nine that
  exist first; check for an upright piano before authoring a seventh.
  *Blocked by S1.*
- **S3** Wire the chamber into the acoustic graph. Send and return cross
  `B1_ATRIUM` past the `room0_threshold`, so the return shares house wiring
  rather than a cable of its own. *Blocked by S1, D3.*
- **S4** Studio props and the dead-channel chore: pull the rack, read the
  schematic in the lid, find the dead valve, buy one at the bodega, return.
  *Blocked by S2.*
- **S5** Connect the studio to the Songbook as its capture half — the bar is
  where songs mutate, the studio is where a take is fixed. Ghost duets belong in
  the room that records. No pitch scoring. *Blocked by S4 and the Songbook's own
  order.*

## R — The street's shops

Built in `art/data/shop_interiors.py`. Guide: `design/SHOP_INTERIOR_BUILD_GUIDE.md`.
**The rooms are display cases, not spaces.** They were authored to be looked
into through a storefront; the owner wants them walked around in, by the player
and by NPCs. R2 needs a brief before anyone builds.

- **R1** Measure before resizing. Interior width is the authored bay less the
  200 mm party-wall inset. **Floor area is the number that matters, and it is
  small**: news 8.4 m², radio 15.0, locksmith 17.0, pawn 26.4, druggist 28.7,
  photo 30.0, funeral 30.8, cobbler 32.4, hardware 33.8, diner 35.0, laundry
  37.8 — all of it under a **3.30 m clear ceiling** (`SHOP_CLEAR`). That ratio
  is the complaint: these are tall narrow slots, not rooms. Player capsule is
  `BODY_RADIUS` 0.33, so a 0.66 m body needs ~0.9 m of aisle not to scrape.
- **R2** Enlarge and re-plan. **RULED BY THE OWNER 2026-08-10: DO NOT GAIN
  SPACE VERTICALLY.** Ceiling height is not usable space — a taller slot is
  still a slot. Three requirements, together: *historically accurate*, *less
  interior clutter so the player can move*, *use the space to its fullest*.
  They reconcile the way a real 1928 shop did — **density at the perimeter,
  clear floor in the middle**. Goods went floor-to-ceiling on the walls, behind
  and under counters, and overhead on rails; the customer floor stayed open,
  because the shopkeeper fetched. Fully stocked and walkable is the period-
  correct answer, not a compromise between them.
  Mechanically: **depth is the cheap axis** — `SHOP_PLAN` cuts further into the
  block and nothing is behind the south row. **Width is not:**
  `_south_street_wall()` makes every shop its own building, so `x0/x1` drives
  the footprint, void, awning, blade and signage together. Two cannot grow
  backward at all — the diner sits in the Harukiya's mass (`nbr_s2`) and the
  druggist in `nbr_w`. Nothing has been built yet: `SHOP_CLEAR/SHOP_H` are
  still 3.30/3.55 and every `SHOP_PLAN` depth is as filed. *Needs the brief.*
- **R3** NPCs have no way in. Movement is anchor-to-anchor in
  `resident_routines.gd` — there is **no NavigationRegion3D or NavigationAgent3D
  anywhere in the project** — so "NPCs move around inside" means authoring venue
  anchors per shop, not dropping a navmesh. Overlaps #22 (favourite spots) and
  should be done with it rather than twice.
- **R5** Two things the re-plan must not break: the **181 per-shop buffers**
  (fittings falling back into floor-wide buffers is what made the bodega go
  black), and `ShopEntryTest`'s ruling that the NEWS CIGARS proprietor side stays
  inaccessible — that one is deliberate, so changing it must be a decision.
  Watch the street elevation too: **32.53 ms** after the door pass streamed 120
  doors (it was 47.11 when this was filed), so there is real headroom for
  fittings now — but it is still double the budget, so spend it deliberately.
- **R6** **Residents walk through furniture, everywhere, today.** `resident_nav.gd`
  builds its AStar graph from `fl["walls"]` alone and never reads a prop, so the
  router cannot see a counter, a shelf or a display case. Harmless while NPCs
  only cross open corridors; fatal the moment they are asked to move inside a
  fitted shop. R2's re-plan is wasted unless the router learns about fittings —
  and the fix is worth having building-wide, not just on the street.


## N — The dream (narcolepsy maze)

Proposed in `design/ORISON_MAZE_BRIEF.md`. **Not canon until the owner rules.**
Nothing below should start before that ruling.

- **N1** Owner ruling on the brief. Three open questions remain at its foot, all
  about which poltergeist is in the dream and when. *Blocks everything else in
  this section.*
- **N2** Fractal maze generator: one seed per save, generated once at campaign
  start, room archetypes drawn from the Orison's own rooms. Must run the same
  overlap / footprint / door-width / door-swing audit `gen_layout.py` does.
- **N3** Narcolepsy onset system in the waking game: gradual and sudden, weak
  resistance, cataplexy on strong emotion, and the accessibility option forcing
  all onsets to be gradual.
- **N4** The light binary — on to see hazards and be found, off to be safe and
  blind. This is the entire verb set and wants prototyping before anything else
  is built around it.
- **N5** Eight hazards across positional, triggered, rhythmic and conditional,
  each with an audible tell that survives the light being off.
- **N6** Bind the pursuer to `PoltergeistLibrary` so the thing in the dream is
  the current case's poltergeist, not a new monster.
- **N7** If ruled canon, add the Rule of Signal exemption to `ORISON_BIBLE.md`
  so the dream is not later read as a violation of §VIII.

## M — Materials and textures

- **M1** Supertiles and stable per-wall UV offsets. Explicitly **not** part of
  the plaster repair, which was fixed without them — an optional later
  anti-repetition enhancement, with a real VRAM cost to decide first.
- **M2** `family_mean_spread` is defined on the compiler side but has never run:
  one texture per material means no family to compare. If the planner ever emits
  texture variants, that gate is unexercised.
- **M3** Compiler textures are 128² at roughly 64 px/m, which is the deeper
  reason features come out large relative to the tile.

## C — Cast (ruled 2026-08-10, ORISON_BIBLE §IV.1)

Six residents carry cases: Mina, Peter, Juno, Cal, Omar, Mae. Rhea and Nadia
are the sanctioned expansion. The other twelve are case-less, **not absent** —
they keep their door, schedule, mailbox and place in the web.

- **C1** ~~Six bespoke case minigames.~~ **Superseded 2026-08-10:** the target
  is a mechanism, not a minigame — see `design/PROP_ACTIVITIES.md` §2. Cases
  express through objects you handle, not through bespoke rules modules. What
  each of the six cases *does* still needs deciding, but it is hours each rather
  than days.
- **C2** Per-resident data is built for 3–5 of the cast on most axes (hero
  models 5, life profiles 3, decor 3, wall art 3). Only animation profiles are
  complete at 18. Decide whether the case six get finished first.
- **C3** The twelve case-less residents need a defined minimum presence — door,
  light, schedule, signature sound, mailbox — so "case-less" reads as a person
  without a chapter rather than an unfinished resident.

## L — Light and decay

- **L1** Bulb burnout and renewal (`design/PROP_ACTIVITIES.md` §4). The
  mechanism is small; the design is the three fixture classes — yours, theirs,
  and the ones that never come back on — and a rate set slightly faster than a
  shift can clear.
- **L2** Bulbs onto the bodega shelf beside the valves, sharing the studio
  chore's errand. One trip, two reasons.
- **L3** Let the infection blow bulbs, so the permanent dark follows the active
  case rather than being tuned by hand.
- **L4** Check `LightRig`'s per-storey budget against fixtures going dark. Should
  be performance-positive, but it was written when the cap was 16 and wants
  re-reading rather than assuming.

## U — Unused and dead systems

From `design/AUDIT_UNUSED_SYSTEMS_REPORT.md` (AUDIT 2, run 2026-08-10). **That
document is the evidence — method, confidence, negative controls. This is the
queue.** Both P0s in it are already repaired: the monitor/signal-terminal split,
and the four isolated roof fixtures now terminating at a real riser.

- **U1** `B1_ROOM0_DOOR` is built data no runtime path reads — a control that
  silently controls nothing. **Owner fiction ruling required:** make
  `Room0.setup()` consume it as the threshold anchor, or remove it at the
  generator and state that Room 0 has no basement entrance. *The audit is
  explicit that deletion must not be chosen silently.* The dream brief does not
  need it either way: that entrance is not physical.
- **U2** `creature_index.json` and the harpy/oni assets — 6.2 MB, zero
  references, and the owner has ruled they are not in the cast. **The audit
  blocked this on the dream ruling; that blocker is now lifted** — the dream's
  antagonist is shapeless and drawn from `PoltergeistLibrary`, with no model,
  rig or animation, so nothing in it reintroduces them. Remaining question is
  only whether to delete or move them outside `game/` so `all_resources` cannot
  package them.
- **U3** Remove the `corridor_light` family — script, registry entry,
  prop-catalog row and the unreachable generator/switch branches, together, with
  no warehouse variant. It is an anachronistic non-signal fluorescent fixture
  that can spawn nowhere. Add a registry audit distinguishing marker-spawned
  kinds from documented warehouse-only kinds (`mail_bank`, `landmark_entry`,
  `arcade_cabinet`, `vantry_point` are all legitimately marker-less).
- **U4** `clock_dials.json` has no consumer and is stale — it names
  `memphis`/`sunburst` while the runtime uses `vantry_modular`/`sunray_1920`,
  duplicated in `DIAL_INDEX`. Delete it, or make the clock read it; do not leave
  a stale second authority.
- **U5** `resident_decor_profiles.json` — a complete seventeen-household
  decorating brief with no consumer. It is *valuable prose in the wrong file
  class*: per `DOCS.md` it is a brief, not game data. **Move it to `design/`**
  rather than delete.
- **U6** The `smoke_detector` alias class has no reference of any kind, but
  external saves may name it. **Decide save compatibility before touching it.**
- **U7** `ROOF_TANK` is an unregistered marker with no graph node or lookup; the
  visible tank is separately baked as `watertank` furniture.

## H — Housekeeping

- **H2** **`C:\FPSengine01` is not a git repository.** The entire compiler side —
  the world compiler, the providers, the arcade catalog build, the texture
  validation — is unversioned files on disk. `git init` and a first commit.
- **H3** `worldc clean --stale` has no test covering it.
- **H13** **Logical placement audit.** Is each object placed correctly, and does it belong there. Convention traps are listed in the brief (door markers are the hinge jamb; pendant markers are ceiling anchors with a drop). Note placement cannot lean on the router to prove a route is clear — see R6, residents walk through furniture. Brief: `design/AUDIT_BRIEF.md`.
